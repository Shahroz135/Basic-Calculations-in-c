# Basic-Calculations-in-c
 All these are some basic programs which
 are used for different purposes like:
▪To convert temperature to/from Celsius 
  to/from Fahrenheit. 
▪To find the area of triangle.
▪To find the volume of sphere.
 In our next step we will try to do 
 programming of additional level.
 If anyone feel/find problems in my coding 
 Please inform me via my e-mail or contact number. 
 So that, we will try to improve ourselves.
